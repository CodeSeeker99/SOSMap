# SOSMap for codefundo++

- An Android app which facilitates relief efforts during and after a natural disaster using maps.
- Users can put up requests for relief material/rescue and upload it on their current location on the map. The app will display all such requests on a map as markers for concerned individuals/authorities to see. Once the request is fulfilled, the account holder can remove the request. Authorities can make a priveledged account where they can put up requests on multiple locations. This will help coordinate municipal as well as local efforts for relief to that area. These accounts can also, modify the state of requests as fulfilled or urgent (This will help target spam). 
- Users can register on the app. This will allow them to make requests as well as see the requests scattered on the map.
- Datasets are provided by the users themselves in the form of requests on the map.
- We're  using Java for android, and google maps API.
